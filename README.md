# Allergen-Detection-System
Allergen Detection System using Python 

The system involves the usage of OpenCV and iPywidgets and a few other packages in python where one could obtain information from the barcode present in the item in supermarkets and after scanning that, one can see if the item is safe for consumption by the user, provided that the user has entered the details about the substances he/she is allergic to. The user will also obtain recommendations about similar foods to be avoided.

The user will also be able to obtain information about the various symptoms he/she might face if the item that contains the allergen is consumed, using the dataset we have formulated through various websites as we couldn't find a concrete dataset that includes information about allergen symptoms.

Here's the dataset used for the list of common allergies found today:

This also includes a decision tree that would help the user determine the possibility of the symptoms and the connections it has to another symptom.
